# Creating your own AEP Plugin

## Initial Setup

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk_flutter)
2. Create a branch with your plugin name off of the main branch e.g: `edge`. Make sure all of the upcoming steps / work is done on your newly created plugin branch. 
3. Make sure you have [flutter installed](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos) on your machine.
4. Follow the steps [outlined here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#step-1-create-the-package-1) to create a template plugin, replace "hello" with your plugin name e.g: `flutter_aepedge`. Note that the existing flutter plugins in the monorepo follow the naming convention `flutter_aep{plugin name}`
